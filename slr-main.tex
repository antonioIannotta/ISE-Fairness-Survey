\begin{abstract}
    The widespread integration of intelligent systems based on artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in sectors such as healthcare, finance, and justice has raised concerns about fairness and discrimination. This Systematic Literature Review (SLR) aims to examine existing research on "fairness" in intelligent systems, with a focus on challenges, proposed solutions, and tools used to address bias in AI/ML-based systems.
    The SLR reviews a wide range of scientific publications, including articles, empirical studies, and guidelines, to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of research. Commonly used approaches and metrics for measuring and mitigating bias in data and algorithms are examined. Additionally, ethical and social challenges associated with the implementation of fair intelligent systems are analyzed, along with key recommendations.
    This work contributes to the understanding of fairness challenges in intelligent systems and serves as a reference for future research and development in this crucial field to ensure fairer and more inclusive systems.

    \textbf{Keywords:} fairness, intelligent systems, artificial intelligence, machine learning, discrimination, bias.
